        Welcome to the help page for
        <span class="textblue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
        project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what

      </p>
      <h5>What is Join?</h5>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        <span class="textblue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
        tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
        their web development bootcamp at the <span class="textblue">Developer Akademie</span>. Kanban, a
        Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
        visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or
        flow). <span class="textblue">Join</span> leverages the principles of
        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
        visual interface. It is important to note that
        <span class="textblue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
        exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
        strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
        consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of
        quality regarding <span class="textblue">Join</span>.

      <h5>How to use it</h5>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="textblue">Join</span>:
      </p>
      <h6>1. Exploring the Board</h6>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        When you log in to <span class="textblue">Join</span>, you'll find a
        default board. This board represents your project and contains four
        default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
      </p>
      <h6>2. Creating Contacts in <span class="textblue">Join</span></h6>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        Creating Contacts In <span class="textblue">Join</span>, you can add
        contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
        added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
        the tasks on the board.
      </p>
      <h6>3. Adding Cards</h6>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
        represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
        list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
        task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </p>
      <h6>4. Moving Cards</h6>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
        board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
      </p>
      <h6>5. Deleting Cards</h6>
      <p class="m-4 text-justify">
        Deleting Cards Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the
        "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
        from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
        action is irreversible. Remember that using
        <span class="textblue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
        updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
        state of your project. Have more questions about
        <span class="textblue">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at [Your
        Contact Email]. We're here to help you!
